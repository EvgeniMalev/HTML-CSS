<div class="content">
    <p><strong>Moskvich</strong> is a historic Russian automobile manufacturer, founded in the early 20th century and known for producing affordable, practical vehicles suited to the rugged conditions of the Soviet Union and modern Russia. Originally established in Moscow, Moskvich cars became an essential part of Soviet automotive culture.</p>

    <p>Moskvich vehicles have been produced in various styles, including sedans, station wagons, and even sportier models at times. The brand had its peak during the Soviet era but faced difficulties in the 1990s as Russia’s economy shifted. Recently, there have been efforts to revive Moskvich, though challenges remain due to modernization needs and competition.</p>
