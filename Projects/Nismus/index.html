        <p class="body-text">Since time immemorial, the planet has been home to tens of 
		thousands of civilizations. Until 15,000,000 years ago, the Kolnite and Salite 
		civilizations shared their lives on this planet. These were two humanoid species 
		that were radically different from each other. The Colnites were the highest 
		civilization created from 14 other civilizations, and that of the Salites was created 
		from a total of 23 civilizations that unified over the last 12,000,000,000 years. 
		The two civilizations conquered neighboring solar systems and yellow gas giants parallel 
		to each other without knowing each other for 1,000,000,000 years. The ignorance of the 
		civilizations about each other was due to the fact that both species existed from 
		separate dimensions.</p>
